# Pass1 and Pass2 Assembler

This project implements a simple assembler for parsing and translating assembly code into object code. The assembler works in two passes:

1. **Pass 1** - Reads the input assembly code and processes labels and addresses, creating a symbol table.
2. **Pass 2** - Generates the object code by translating the opcodes and operands into machine-readable code, utilizing the symbol table created during Pass 1.

## Features

- **Input File Parsing:** Reads assembly instructions line by line and breaks them into tokens (label, opcode, operand).
- **Symbol Table Generation:** Creates a symbol table for labels and addresses.
- **Object Code Generation:** Produces object code with addresses, labels, and opcodes.
- **Hexadecimal Addressing:** Updates addresses and lengths in hexadecimal format.
- **Flexible Input/Output:** Can be used with user-specified input and output file paths.

## File Structure

1. **`symtab`**: Symbol table generated by Pass 1 containing labels and their corresponding addresses.
2. **`output`**: The output object code generated by Pass 2.
3. **`optab`**: The opcode table containing opcodes and their machine code representations (to be used in Pass 2).
4. **`input.asm`**: The input assembly code file.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile the code.
- A basic understanding of how an assembler works.

### Compilation

To compile the assembler program, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
gcc -o pass1_pass2_assembler pass1_pass2_assembler.c
